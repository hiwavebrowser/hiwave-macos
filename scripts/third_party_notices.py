The crate list is `cargo tree -p hiwave-app -e normal` (default features) for both macOS
targets, HiWave's own crates left out. Licence expressions and repository URLs are each
crate's `Cargo.toml` fields. Copyright lines and licence texts are read from the crates'
published sources, which `cargo fetch` puts under ~/.cargo/registry. Texts that no crate in
the tree carries are in scripts/third_party_notices_data/.

What this script cannot find is written by hand below and must be kept current by hand:
works copied into the source that are not crates (Chart.js, the CLDR tables, code ported
into the vendored Boa), section 6, and the obligations text. A licence file below a crate's
root that the NESTED table does not know stops the run, so a new one gets read by a person.
