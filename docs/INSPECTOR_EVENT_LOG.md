# HiWave Inspector event log

The engine keeps a per-view, ordered record of what a page load did: what
Chrome's Console panel shows (console calls, uncaught errors, unhandled
rejections), what the engine does not implement that the page used, and the
navigation and lifecycle markers. The Network half (requests and their
outcomes) is documented in the section added with it.

Code: `crates/rustkit-engine/src/inspector.rs` (types, buffer, sinks) and
`inspector_glue.rs` (where page script reaches it).

## Turning it on

Nothing is recorded unless something listens. With nobody listening every
recording call returns after one atomic load: no event is built, no string
formatted.

- `EngineConfig::inspector.buffer = true`: each view keeps its last
  `capacity` events (default 4096) in a ring buffer; past it the oldest is
  dropped and counted.
- `Engine::add_inspector_sink(view, sink)`: every event also goes to the sink
  (`JsonLinesSink`, `RollingFileSink`, or your own `InspectorSink`). Attach
  before loading: console capture and rejection tracking are set up when a
  document is committed.
- `Engine::inspector(view)` returns an `Arc<Inspector>` that can be kept and
  read from any thread, including while the page's script runs:
  `snapshot_since(n)` returns the buffered records with `seq >= n`, the next
  `seq`, and how many records the buffer has dropped. Reading runs no script.

## Records (JSON Lines)

One JSON object per line. Every record starts with:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `seq` | 0-based, per view, consecutive, never reused |
| `t_ms` | milliseconds since the current navigation started (monotonic) |
| `type` | the event kind, below |

Then the kind's fields, in this order. Fields are only ever appended; a
field that is `null` today may hold a value later.

| `type` | fields |
|---|---|
| `navigation_start` | `url` (`null` for `load_html`) |
| `navigation_commit` | `url`, `status` (HTTP status; `null` for `load_html`) |
| `load_finished` | `url`, `scripts_over_budget` (scripts not run, or stopped, because the script budget was spent) |
| `load_ended_early` | `url`, `reason` (`navigated_away`, `failed`), `detail` (`stopped`, `another navigation started`, `HTTP 404`, or a one-word network stage: `dns`, `connect`, `tls`, `timeout`, `policy`, `redirect`, `http`, `network`, `invalid_url`, `over_budget`, `cancelled`) |
| `console` | `level` (`log`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `debug`), `message`, `truncated`, `location` |
| `script_error` | `name` (`TypeError`, ...; empty for a thrown non-error), `message`, `location`, `stack`, `unhandled_rejection`, `script` |
| `unsupported_api` | `interface`, `member`, `location` (first sighting on the page) |
| `first_layout` | — |
| `first_paint` | — |
| `relayout` | `cause` (the value of the `relayout cause=` log line), `took_ms` |

`location` is `null` or `{ "url", "line", "column" }` (1-based). `url` is the
script's URL, or `inline#n` for the page's n-th `<script>` when it is inline
(the line then counts from the start of that script's text). Lines and
columns are the JS engine's (Boa): a call's column is its `(`, a property
access's is the property name, and an error raised by a name lookup inside an
anonymous function can carry the function's start instead.

`script` names what ran the code: a script URL, `inline#n`, or the engine
step (`event:DOMContentLoaded`, `event:load`, `event:resize`,
`event:<mouse event>`, `timers`, `network`).

`stack` holds the page's frames only (`    at name (url:line:col)` lines),
capped at 4096 characters.

### Unsupported APIs

Recorded where the bindings know they do not implement something and page
script reaches it: `XMLHttpRequest.open(async=false)`,
`XMLHttpRequest.responseXML`, `CustomElementRegistry.define(extends)`,
`ReadableStream.getReader(byob)`, `DOMParser.parseFromString(XML)`. One event
per member per page; `Inspector::unsupported_apis()` and the summary carry the
counts. Property reads that fall through to `undefined` are not detected:
that needs a hook on every property access (see the PR that added this).

## Privacy

The log is meant to be pasted into public issues and PRs.

- Every URL keeps its scheme, host, port and path. User name and password are
  always removed; query and fragment are removed unless
  `InspectorConfig::keep_url_query` (`parity-capture --event-log-keep-query`)
  is set. A `data:` URL becomes `data:<mime>,…`; a `blob:` URL its origin.
- URLs inside error messages and stacks are scrubbed the same way.
- No request or response header, body, cookie, form value or storage content
  is recorded.
- Console messages are page-controlled text: capped at 1024 characters and
  stored as they are, never interpreted. A page can put anything in them,
  including a URL with its query: read them as untrusted text.

## `parity-capture --event-log <file> --event-summary`

`--event-log` writes the whole load's records (nothing dropped) as JSON Lines.
`--event-summary` adds `event_summary` to the result JSON printed on stdout.
The site board publishes it per site, so its layout is stable: fields keep
their names and order, maps are sorted by key, new fields are only appended,
and `schema` goes up when one is.

```json
{
  "schema": 1,
  "events": 42,
  "console": { "log": 3, "info": 0, "warn": 1, "error": 2, "debug": 0 },
  "script_errors": 4,
  "unhandled_rejections": 1,
  "unsupported_apis": { "XMLHttpRequest.open(async=false)": 3 }
}
```

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `schema` | layout version (1) |
| `events` | records in the load's log |
| `console` | console calls by level |
| `script_errors` | uncaught exceptions plus unhandled rejections |
| `unhandled_rejections` | of `script_errors`, the rejections |
| `unsupported_apis` | `Interface.member` to how often page script reached it |
