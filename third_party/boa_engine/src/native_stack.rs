//! HIWAVE PATCH (native recursion): a budget on the native (Rust) stack that built-ins and
//! internal methods check, so a page cannot recurse the process to death.
//!
//! Boa's JS frames live on the heap, but a built-in that recurses in Rust (JSON.stringify of
//! nested arrays, `flat`, `join` through `toString`, a Proxy or prototype chain, bound
//! functions) uses the real stack, and a 200 000-deep structure overflowed it and aborted the
//! process. Chrome throws a catchable `RangeError`. The origin is the stack address where the
//! outermost entry into the engine on this thread began; a check throws once more than the
//! budget has been used since.
