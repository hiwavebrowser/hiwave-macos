//! `@container` size queries (css-contain-3 §6) at style time.
//!
//! A rule inside `@container` applies to an element only where its
//! condition holds for the element's query container: the nearest ancestor
//! with a `container-type` other than `normal` (and the queried
//! `container-name`, when one is given). Chrome answers the query with the
//! container's laid-out size. The cascade here runs before layout, so the
//! walk carries an estimate of each box's content width instead.
//!
//! The estimate is an allowlist (#782 HOLD 3): a width is known only when
//! the container and every ancestor up to the root are plain in-flow
//! blocks, each with an auto width (its parent's width less its margins,
//! borders and padding) or a length or percentage of its parent's width.
//! A plain block here is `display: block` (which includes `list-item` and
//! `flow-root`), horizontal-tb, not floated or absolutely positioned, not a
//! `-webkit-box`, not a form control, replaced element or `dialog`, with no
//! sizing keyword (`min-content`, `fit-content`, ...) in `width`,
//! `min-width` or `max-width`, no `aspect-ratio` on an auto width, and not
//! a child of a multi-column box. After a float anywhere earlier in the
//! same formatting context (#782 HOLD 4: however tall its ancestors are,
//! since only layout knows where it ends), an auto-width box that starts a
//! formatting context is narrowed by it, and so is one the walk cannot see
//! (`flow-root`, `contain`, `overflow-y`), so any width, `min-width` or
//! `max-width` there other than a length is unknown too. A float counts
//! whether it is an element or a floated `::before`, `::after` or
//! `::first-letter`, and inside an inline box or `display: contents`
//! element, which never start a context (#782 HOLD 5). An absolute or
//! fixed `border-box` container with percentage padding is unknown: the
//! padding resolves against its containing block, not its parent.
//!
//! Everything else is unknown, and a query on an unknown container does not
//! hold, which is how the engine treated every `@container` rule before:
//! flex, grid and table descendants, inline and `display: contents`
//! containers, floats, absolute boxes, vertical writing modes. Some of
//! those have a width Chrome knows (a `flex: none` item, a table with a
//! fixed width); they stay false rather than risk a guess wider than the
//! laid-out box.
//!
//! CQ1: a view's layout measures every size container's content box, and
//! the next build answers with that (`MeasuredContainers`); the engine lays
//! out again while those sizes move (`LayoutCtx::lay_out_document`), so a
//! flex or grid item, which the estimate cannot see, is answered with its
//! laid-out size, and a resize is answered again. A measurement is used
//! only where the engine's layout is known to agree with Chrome's
//! (`layout_trusted`); elsewhere the fail-safe above still holds. A
//! container sized by its contents is measured too: rustkit-layout applies
//! inline-size containment to its intrinsic widths (CQ2), as Chrome does.
//! Only the inline size moves a layout again: an `inline-size` container's
//! height is not recorded. A chain of more than two nested
//! containers, each sized by the answer of the one outside it, does not
//! settle in one layout: the pass cap returns, the next relayout goes on
//! from the stored sizes, and the cap is counted
//! (`ViewLayout::container_unsettled`).
//!
//! Not covered: container-relative units (`cq*`) and style queries.
