//! DOM1: two things the DOM got wrong about what the author wrote.
//!
//! * Attribute order. rustkit-dom kept an element's attributes in a
//!   `HashMap`, so `attributes`, `getAttributeNames()`, `outerHTML` /
//!   `innerHTML` and XMLSerializer wrote them in name order. Chrome keeps
//!   the order they were written or set in: setting an existing name keeps
//!   its place, removing and adding it again puts it last.
//! * Hit testing. A box outside its ancestor's box was not hit: an
//!   absolutely positioned menu under a 24px header, a float in a
//!   zero-height parent, content taller than an `overflow: visible` box.
//!   `elementFromPoint` answered BODY and a click did not focus a field
//!   there. Under `overflow: hidden` the part outside is still not hit.
//!
//! Expected lines: docs/diagnostics/2026-11-12/dom1_attribute_order_cft148.txt
//! and dom1_hit_outside_ancestor_cft148.txt, `window.report()` of the pages
//! beside them in Chrome for Testing 148.0.7778.216 at 800x600.

///   so `el.style.color = 'red'` followed by `setAttribute('x', ..)` reads
///   `x,style`. Here the attribute is written at once (`style,x`).

///   defect; the hit test finds the box where the layout put it.
