//! Cmd chords offered to the page first, and how long they wait for it (M1e).
//!
//! A Cmd chord Chromium does not reserve goes to the page's keydown before
//! the menu (CH2.E3): the view holds the chord, the page answers whether it
//! claimed it, and an unclaimed one goes on to the menu. The page answers
//! from its own thread, which a load can hold for seconds (an image the
//! server held 8 s kept Cmd+L from the address bar for 6.4 s, M1d #1012).
//! So a chord waits [`CHORD_ANSWER_TIMEOUT`] at most: one the page has not
//! answered by then is unclaimed and goes to the menu, and the page's late
//! answer, claimed or not, is dropped. The menu runs once, and a claim
//! that comes too late does not take the chord back.
//!
//! One actor (M1g, #1015 delta R1 5835356948): when the page's thread
//! reaches a chord whose wait already ran out, it does not dispatch the
//! chord's keydown at all ([`HeldChords::begin`]). Otherwise a page with
//! its own handler for the chord (a web app that switches panes on Cmd+2)
//! would act as well as the menu, and after a Cmd+digit tab switch it would
//! act in the tab the menu just left. This is a divergence from Chrome on
//! the timeout path only: Chrome has no timeout and always delivers the
//! keydown before the menu sees the chord. The cost is that a page's
//! observe-only listener misses a key the user pressed while its thread was
//! held for more than 100 ms. A chord whose keydown the page has started
//! is the page's to answer: its wait running out then sends nothing to the
//! menu, and the page's answer (claimed or not) decides, as in Chrome.
//!
//! Two bounds on that (#1023 R1): a started chord that is never answered
//! (the page's thread died, the view was torn down mid-dispatch) is given
//! up after [`STARTED_CHORD_GIVE_UP`] and goes to the menu, so it neither
//! stays held nor leaks its `NSEvent`; a listener that just runs long is
//! stopped first by the app's 5 s live turn budget, whose end lets the
//! page answer. And later chords keep their order: one whose wait runs out
//! while an earlier chord's keydown is still running in the page (it
//! cannot have been reached) waits for that chord's answer and then goes
//! to the menu ([`HeldChords::release_due`]), rather than running ahead of
//! it.
//!
//! Why 100 ms: it is the response budget a press has before the delay is
//! felt (RAIL: respond to input within 100 ms), and far above what an idle
//! page thread takes to run a keydown listener and answer (the in-time
//! cases in `tests/macos_chord_wait.rs` answer in 10-20 ms). A page whose
//! thread is free keeps every chord it cancels, as in Chrome; only a page
//! whose thread is held past the budget loses it to the menu. The
//! real-window gate (`m1d_cmd_l_while_loading`) allows 250 ms from the
//! press to the address bar, the timeout plus the menu action and the
//! chrome's focus.
