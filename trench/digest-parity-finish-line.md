Metric: `N/26 finish-line-green` (geometry ∧ paint ∧ stable ∧ no-discrete).
Baseline and rules: `trench/BASELINE-parity-finish-line.md`.

**Metric: UNMEASURABLE → UNMEASURABLE.** No oracle exists yet, so there is no
number to move. What changed is that the thing making the oracle *unbuildable*
is gone: RustKit's `layout.json` now carries a join key. Gates A/B/C and
stability enforcement are still unbuilt — that is P0a, next.

**P-item: P0a-0 (export element identity in layout.json). Completed.**

### Commits

- `742521d` — export `element_id` + `tag` + `selector` per element box; anonymous
  and text boxes carry `identity: None` and emit no identity fields.
- `b126404` — corpus test proving the key joins: 1593/1593 Chrome baseline
  selectors reproduced across all 26 cases. Includes the SVG `className` fix it
  caught.

### What the work actually was

The plan's framing was that `LayoutBox` already carries `element_id` and the
export just needed to emit it. That was wrong in a way worth recording:
`set_element_id` has **zero callers**, so `element_id` was always `None`. There
was no identity to export — it had to be produced first, during layout tree
construction, by mirroring Chrome's `getSelector()`.

Two quirks of the capture script are reproduced deliberately, because they are
the committed join key rather than a style choice:

- raw `className` concatenated after one dot, so a multi-class element keys as
  `div.card featured`, space intact — not valid CSS, but it is what 572 baseline
  selectors say
- `:nth-of-type(N)` only when a tag has more than one element sibling

`Option` on the identity is load-bearing and stayed that way: anonymous and text
boxes have no element, so they are excluded from comparison rather than paired
positionally. An oracle that silently pairs an anonymous box with a real element
reports geometry failures that do not exist.

### Mutation-check results

Six guards, each mutated, observed red, and restored:

| Mutation | Test | Result |
|---|---|---|
| multi-class join `.join(" ")` → `.join(".")` | `multi_class_selector_keeps_the_baseline_space_form` | RED |
| `same_tag_total > 1` → `> 0` (always append nth) | `nth_of_type_is_omitted_for_a_lone_sibling…` | RED |
| id short-circuit inverted | `reported_selector_honors_id_short_circuit…` | RED |
| identity insert removed from export | both `export_emits_identity_*` | RED (2 tests) |
| identity insert made unconditional | `export_omits_identity_for_anonymous_and_text_boxes` | RED |
| foreign-content class suppression removed | `every_chrome_baseline_selector_is_reproduced…` | RED, exactly the 3 shelf svg selectors |

Tests avoid `build_layout_from_document` on purpose. It needs a GPU compositor
and `return`s silently when none is present — this runner has no adapter, so any
test routed through it is vacuous here. `test_layout_tree_from_document` prints
"Skipping test: GPU not available" and still reports `ok`. Everything added runs
on any machine.

### Decisions needed from Pete

1. **`tools/parity_oracle/capture_baseline.mjs` has drifted from the script that
   produced `baselines/chrome-148`** — it now emits `div.card.featured` where
   every committed baseline says `div.card featured`, so regenerating baselines
   today would silently break 572 join keys; pin the script back to the committed
   form (my recommendation, plus a test), or regenerate and re-mirror the engine?
2. **The intrinsic-sizing cache in `rustkit-layout/src/intrinsic_cache.rs` is
   entirely dead** — `lookup_*`/`store_*` have no callers outside their own unit
   tests; keep it as planned future work, or is it stale? (Asking because it is
   the documented reason `element_id` exists, and its deadness is what made
   populating `element_id` provably behavior-neutral.)
3. None beyond those two.

### Surprises

- **`element_id` was never populated.** The plan described it as "currently used
  only for the intrinsic-sizing cache". It is used for nothing: the field is
  always `None` and the cache it keys has no call sites at all. This was good
  news — it means setting it cannot change layout, so P0a-0 holds the
  no-engine-behavior-change rule provably rather than by inspection.
- **A classed inline `<svg>` broke the join, and only the corpus test caught it.**
  Chrome's capture guards on `typeof el.className === 'string'`; for SVG elements
  `className` is an `SVGAnimatedString`, so the guard fails and the class is
  dropped — the baseline keys it as plain `svg`. My first implementation appended
  the class and lost `shelf.html`'s svg and both its children. Three elements
  that would have been scored as "no geometry error" because they were never
  compared at all. This is the failure mode the whole campaign is about, and it
  showed up on night 1 in the instrument itself. The unit tests were all green
  when it happened; only running against the real corpus found it.
- **`scripts/layout_oracle_gate.py` already exists and is a stub.** Its
  `extract_layout_from_rustkit` returns `None` with a comment saying layout
  dumping does not exist yet. P0a should finish this file rather than start a
  new one.
- The 26-case corpus spans three source roots (`websuite/cases`,
  `websuite/micro`, `crates/hiwave-app/src/ui`), which is worth knowing before
  P0a wires up case discovery.

### Process note

Mid-session I ran `cargo fmt` and it reformatted 7 files unrelated to the change
— the repo is not fmt-clean — then later lost ~40 minutes of uncommitted work to
a `git checkout --` used to revert a mutation. Both recovered, nothing shipped
wrong, but the lesson for later nights is: commit before mutation-checking, and
never blanket-format in a re-instrument PR where diff attributability is the
whole point.

## 2026-08-05

**Metric: UNMEASURABLE → UNMEASURABLE.** Gate A now exists and is honest, but
it has never been pointed at a real RustKit capture: every capture path needs a
GPU adapter and this seat is Linux without one. Gates B and C and the stability
hole are still unbuilt. The number arrives at P0b, on macOS, as planned.

**P-item: P0a (build the four gates). NOT completed — 1 of 4 landed.**
Gate A (geometry) is done. Gate B (paint tolerance + discrete-structural
auto-fail), Gate C (non-gating forensic board), and stability at
`pr_merge`/`nightly` remain. I did not start them; reasoning below.

### Commits

- `00f02db` — Gate A: `scripts/layout_oracle_gate.py` stops being a stub and
  compares RustKit `border_box` against Chrome `getBoundingClientRect` at 0.5px
  per axis, joined on the P0a-0 selector. 13 tests.
- `3970e83` — delete one decorative guard, make the other load-bearing, after
  the mutation sweep caught both.
- `610fb78` — score only the registry-viewport capture; an off-viewport dump is
  unmeasured, not measured wrongly.

Zero engine behavior changes across all three. Instrument only, so P0b's first
`N/26` stays attributable.

### What Gate A refuses to do

Everything it cannot honestly score fails rather than passing quietly:

| Situation | Verdict |
|---|---|
| box differs > 0.5px on x/y/width/height | `delta`, one receipt line per axis |
| Chrome has the box, RustKit does not | `missing_box` |
| two RustKit boxes claim one selector | `ambiguous_selector` — never first-matched |
| RustKit sized something Chrome collapsed | `phantom_box` |
| capture absent, unreadable, or off-viewport | UNMEASURED, which fails |
| run measured nothing at all | FAIL, not "all 0 cases pass" |

Anonymous and text boxes carry no selector and are excluded, never paired
positionally. Chrome's own omissions (zero-size elements; the
script/style/meta/link/head/title/html skip list in `capture_baseline.mjs`) are
mirrored, or the gate would invent phantoms on every page.

Receipt format is the one fixed in plan §2 and nothing else:

```
card-grid · 3 body > div.header:nth-of-type(1) > p · x · 40 · 46.25 · +6.25
card-grid · — body > div.grid:nth-of-type(2) > div.card:nth-of-type(1) > h3 · missing_box · — · — · —
```

### Mutation-check results

14 mutations, each applied, suite observed, fix restored. **14/14 RED.**

| Mutation | Test that caught it |
|---|---|
| tolerance 0.5px → 50px | `every_axis_is_compared_independently` |
| join on `content_rect` instead of `border_box` | `one_perturbed_box_produces_exactly_one_receipt` |
| ambiguous selector first-matched | `a_duplicate_selector_is_reported_not_first_matched` |
| identity `Option` ignored, unselectored boxes paired | `a_box_chrome_would_have_captured…` |
| `missing_box` downgraded to a skip | `a_box_rustkit_never_emitted_is_a_failure` |
| `phantom_box` detection removed | `a_box_chrome_would_have_captured…` |
| Chrome skip-list not mirrored | `chromes_own_omissions_are_not_phantoms` |
| zero-size boxes not exempt from phantom rule | `chromes_own_omissions_are_not_phantoms` |
| unmeasured case recorded as green | `a_run_with_no_captures_fails…` |
| `measured == 0` tripwire removed | `an_unknown_case_filter_discovers_nothing_and_fails` |
| holdout scope allowed to gate | `a_run_with_no_captures_fails…` |
| only x/y compared | `every_axis_is_compared_independently` |
| receipt loses the selector column | `one_perturbed_box_produces_exactly_one_receipt` |
| any viewport's capture accepted | `only_the_registry_viewport_capture_is_scored` |

The first sweep was 12/14. Both failures were in `gate_passes`, and both were
"0 cases discovered is not a pass" checks — the exact guard class this campaign
exists to defend, shipped uncovered. One was genuinely subsumed and is deleted;
the other defends a different failure and is now asserted against the predicate.

### Decisions needed from Pete

1. Night 1's question is still open and now blocks more: `capture_baseline.mjs`
   emits `div.card.featured` where every committed baseline says
   `div.card featured` — regenerating baselines today silently breaks 572 join
   keys and Gate A with them; pin the script back (my recommendation) or
   regenerate and re-mirror the engine?
2. Should Gate A be wired into `.github/workflows/parity.yml` as advisory
   (prints receipts, does not block) for one cycle before it gates, so its
   behavior on real captures is observed on macOS before it can red-lock PRs?
3. Nothing else.

### Surprises

- **The gate's own tripwires were decoration.** I wrote two "a run that measured
  nothing is not a pass" checks, with a comment citing the B3 precedent, and
  both stayed green when removed. The suite that was supposed to prove the
  instrument honest had the instrument's own disease. Only the mutation sweep
  found it — the tests were 13/13 green.
- **My first mutation harness lied twice.** It reported RED for a mutation that
  was actually green, and later reported 13/13 RED on a file with a
  `SyntaxError` — every mutation "failed the suite" because nothing could
  import. A mutation harness that cannot distinguish "the guard caught it" from
  "the file does not parse" produces exactly the confident wrong number this
  campaign is about. It now compiles the mutated file first, and the sweep is
  scripted rather than eyeballed.
- **Selectors are unique per case on the Chrome side** — 1757 elements across
  all 32 baselines, zero duplicates — so the join is a dict lookup, not a
  matching problem. The RustKit side is not guaranteed unique, which is why
  `ambiguous_selector` exists rather than a first-match.
- **The swarm's multi-viewport output was a live trap.** Naive discovery would
  have scored a 1920x1080 dump against 800x600 baselines and produced a
  page-wide geometry failure that looks precisely like the layout bugs P1–P6
  are hunting. It would have been believed.

### Why P0a stopped at one gate

Gate A could be validated tonight because its input on the Chrome side is
committed: 1593 real boxes to join against, so "the gate works" is a measured
claim rather than an inspected one. Gate B needs real RustKit frames and Gate C
needs real heatmaps, and neither can be produced on this seat. Writing them
blind would have added two gates whose only evidence is that they look right —
which is the kind of instrument this campaign was opened to stop shipping.
So: one gate, measured. P0a continues next night.
